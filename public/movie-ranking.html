<h1>The Best Movies According to David</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Sword Art Online</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the concept of immersive VRMMO.
 <br/>
 Sword Art Online is one of the best anime ever created. Combining a moving plot, interesting characters, and an incredible soundtrack, the first arc of the show even outshines the Frieza Saga of Dragonball Z. The show is split into three main arcs: Aincrad, Fairy Dance, and Phantom Bullet.

<h3>Amadeus</h3>
<p>F. Murray Abraham gave an Oscar-winning performance as the jealous Antonio Salieri, and Tom Hulce earned praise as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The lavish production won eight Oscars, including for best picture and Forman's second for best director.</p>
<h3>Armageddon</h3>
<p>It's melodramatic. It's an explosion of baroque excess that splats on the screen and bludgeons the audience into a collective migraine. It's the best American movie of the year. Armageddon isn't made for grown-ups, and it isn't made for kids, either; I'm not sure it's made for human beings, period.</p>
